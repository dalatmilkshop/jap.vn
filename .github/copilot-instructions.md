# Copilot Instructions for jap.vn

## Project Overview
- **jap.vn** appears to be a simple web-based project, possibly a static site or archive, with minimal structure: `index.html`, `story.html`, and a `README.md`.
- There is no evidence of a build system, test framework, or external dependencies in the current codebase.

## Key Files
- `index.html`: Likely the main entry point for the site.
- `story.html`: Additional content or a subpage.
- `README.md`: Contains only a brief project description.

## Development Patterns
- **No frameworks or build tools**: All files are static HTML. There are no package managers, scripts, or configuration files present.
- **No custom conventions**: File naming and structure follow standard static site practices.
- **No integration points**: No backend, API, or external service integration is present.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- Focus on clear, maintainable HTML. If adding new pages, follow the naming and structure of existing files.
- If introducing new technologies (CSS, JS, build tools), document them in the `README.md` and ensure compatibility with the current static setup.
- Keep navigation and linking between pages simple and consistent.
- If expanding the project, consider creating a `docs/` or `assets/` directory for organization.

## Example Patterns
- To add a new page, create a new `.html` file at the root and link it from `index.html`.
- For styling, add inline `<style>` tags or link a CSS file if needed.

## Missing or Unclear Areas
- No explicit instructions for deployment, contribution, or advanced workflows are present. Clarify with maintainers if such workflows are needed.
